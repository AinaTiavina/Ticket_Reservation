### Data Format
    Generally, we use JSON as a response from the server thus all responses are very easy to handle with JS as it is common a JavaScript Object. Whereas, a different data format occurs while we send a request to the server. It depends on the operation that we want to process.
    The Event needs to upload an image file, as a consequence we need to handle it and store its path inside the database. In order to make it successful, we ought to use a different data format called multipart-form-data. It is a suitable format for uploading an image.

| Subjects | Methods | Data Format |
|:--------:|:-------:|:-----------:|
| *Client, Reservation* | **POST** | ***JSON*** |
| *Event* | **POST/PUT(Creation/Modification)** | ***multipart/form-data*** |
